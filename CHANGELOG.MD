#  Version 3.0 Release Notes
This is the changelog for the initial push of 3.0 into Master:
- Below is a list of features that are being pushed to the Main site
- If you encounter any Bugs, please post your Spoiler log and [BPS](https://dev.dk64randomizer.com/bps_maker) with an explanation of the bug in the #3.0-Bug-Reports [Discord Channel](https://discord.dk64randomizer.com).

## CHANGELOG
### New Hints
- **Multipath**: A whole new rework to the hint system from 2.0 where a region check can hint multiple path items. Example below:
	- "Something in the Outer Isles is on the path to Keys 7 and 8 and K. Rool vs. Chunky and Diddy."
	- ONE item in the Outer Isles will be on the path to Key 7, Key 8, Chunky's K. Rool Phase, and Diddy's K. Rool Phase
	- That one item will ONLY be on the path to those Keys/Phases meaning that it will not lead to Key 4 or Tiny's K. Rool Phase
- **Direct Item Hinting**: Instead of your standard hints with paths and Way of the Hoard, this new hint system will directly tell you where your moves and keys are. This hint system will also tell you some other important hints such as Helm and Krool Phases. This hint system will prioritize which moves you need, but it can give you useless moves. It is up to you to figure out which moves you need. For Example: Looking for Simian Spring? Try looking in Forest with Chunky
- **Advanced Item Hinting**: Same functionality as above, but instead of telling you the specific move, it will instead hint the Item type. For Example: Looking for kong pad moves? Try looking in the Giant Mushroom Insides.
- **Spoiler Hints**: This is an independent hint system from the Wrinkly doors. Your spoiler log will contain a "Spoiler Hints" section that will reveal some information about the seed that may help you as you explore. This "Spoiler Hints" section will be in the spoiler log regardless of whether or not you checked the Generate Spoiler Log option. This makes these hints viable for racing, if you were wondering. One small quirk: training moves count as Isles! Spoiler Hints come in two forms. Vials, and Points
	- **Vials**: The levels of Keys, Kongs, and vials are hinted. Vials include their color.
	- **Points**: Inspired by other randomizers, each world is assigned a point value based on its contents. The value of each category of items provides can be customized on the website.
	- **Tracker**: This Hint system works with OnlySpaghettiCode's Track-o-Matic Tracker which can be found [here](https://github.com/Brian0255/Track-O-Matic/releases/latest)
- **Progressive Hints**: You can now unlock your hints with Golden Bananas instead of going through each lobby. You can select how many GBs it costs to unlock your last hint.
- **Dim Solved Hints**: This option will dim any hints that you have acquired the item to. (This won't be enabled in any Racing Preset)
- **New Hint Type Changes**: There are now a few changes made to the types of hints you can see:
	- **Region Potion Counts**: You can now get hints that tell you how many potions are in a region. These potions can very from very important to bait potions
	- B. Locker and Troff & Scoff hints are now removed from filler hints
	- You can no longer find more than 1 K. Rool/Helm Order Hint in a seed.

- **Switchsanity**: Various pads and switches across the game have been randomized, resulting in different requirements to reach certain areas.
