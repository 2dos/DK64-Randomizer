# Suggestions
## FruityLoops
Pricing Info: $0 trial, $99 afterwards
- Capable of doing everything you'd want, but it's workflow isn't optimized for MIDI
- Visually customizable
- Trial version can do everything the premium version can, but it can't reopen saved flp projects
 
## Synthfont
Pricing Info: V1 is free, $22 for V2 but with a 30 day free trial
- Fully fledged tool for midi editing.
- It has a streamlined instrument change window, but can still do standard midi editing with a piano roll.
- Focused around MIDI editing, so doesn't have some of the quirks of FruityLoops
- Recommended for newcomers
 
## Reaper
Pricing Info: 60-day free trial, $60 afterwards or have a WinRAR/PJ64-esque prompt upon boot every time
- Allows all functionality of a standard good music editor
- SoundFonts are supported if you download a 3rd party VST
 
## Musescore 4
Pricing Info: Free
- Way better at being notation software that Musescore 3
- Whilst it does support custom SoundFont, it doesn't allow custom names. As such, you'll be stuck with the general MIDI names
- Might have the same issues as Musescore 3 regarding instruments.
 
## Musescore 3
Pricing Info: Free
- Slightly dated notation software, not streamlined for MIDI or notation
- Takes a while to get midi things rolling like the view>synthesizer window being the place select the SoundFont (after adding it in preferences).
- Supports custom SoundFont with custom names, but it doesn't have much CC control other than at the start and for volume continuously
- Has a number of problems regarding instruments with others who have tried MIDI editing with Musescore 3 for DK64. [Proceed with caution](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1003685939907924038/1120471703500361869/image.png)
 
## BRELs MIDI Editor
Pricing Info: Free
- Allows you to open MIDIs, alter, and save MIDIs out in a number of ways
- Very old (Last version was released in Apr 2011)
- Does not support using a custom SoundFont
- UI and controls can range from intuitive to confusing
- No tempo snapping, just to each MIDI tick
 
## Signal
Pricing Info: Free
- Allows you to open MIDIs, change/add/remove notes, change instruments and save MIDIs out
- Doesn't seem to have the capability to alter non-note/instrument events like pan/reverb
- Doesn't support using a custom SoundFont
- Categorization of instruments isn't based on index in the general MIDI SoundFont, but rather group of where that instrument lies in a music family

# Avoid
## LMMS
- Doesn't properly export to MIDI. Topics have been open on their forum about this since 2020, so it doesn't seem like they're in a rush to fix this. Mostly just serves as a "change the instrument with the SoundFont to see what sounds good"
## OpenMPT
- Basically the same pros and cons as LMMS. The lack of properly saving to MIDI, like LMMS, makes this a hard avoid.
