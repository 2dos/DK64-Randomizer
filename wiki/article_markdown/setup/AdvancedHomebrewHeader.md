The advanced homebrew ROM Header allows DK64 Randomizer to work on some mupen-based emulators but does break functionality of some other platforms.

# Where to use the header
**DO** use the header if you are going to run on one of the following platforms (All of these aren't officially supported by the randomizer yet):
* Rosalie's Mupen GUI
* Simple 64
* Mupen 64 FZ

**DO NOT** use the header if you are going to run on one of the following platforms:
* Everdrive 64 Version 2.5
* Everdrive 64 Version 3.0 (Using 2.X OS)
* Wii U Virtual Console
* Any unofficial Everdrive (eg. Everdrive 64 Plus, Chinese Everdrive)

# Help, I applied the setting incorrectly
If, by accident, you apply the wrong setting, there is a way to correct this. The [Homebrew Header Swapper](https://theballaam96.github.io/homebrew_header_swapper.html) tool swaps whether your ROM has the homebrew header or not. It will tell you whether your input ROM had the homebrew header and provide you a ROM which has the opposite.
