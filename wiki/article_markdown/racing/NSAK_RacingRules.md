# General Rules
- The preferred generator for "No Style, All Keys" (Will be frequently referred to as "NSAK") Racing is the 2.1 generator, currently on the [dev site](https://dev.dk64randomizer.com)
- Timer starts immediately upon pressing "A" on the screen where it displays your file's items.
- Timing ends with the collection of the last Key (typically 8 locked in helm)
- All races will be hosted on racetime.gg. You need to link your Twitch 
- Racetime will be the official timing for the races. If racers are within 5 seconds of each other, the race mod will manually retime the race to determine the winner. 
- Past broadcasts MUST be enabled. (On Twitch, go to Creator Dashboard > Settings > Stream. Enable “Store past broadcasts” and “Always Publish VODs”.) You also need to make a local recording in case internet/Twitch goes out
