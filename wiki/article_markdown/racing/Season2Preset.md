# General Rules

* Timer starts immediately upon pressing "A" on the screen where it displays your file's items.
* Timer ends on the end of the final (3rd) phase of the fight. The following situations determine when the timer stops:
  * DK Phase: The start of the cutscene where K Rool gets hit the final (3rd) time and falls to the floor.
  * Diddy Phase: Immediately after hitting the final switch on the final (3rd) light to knock it down.
  * Lanky Phase: The start of the cutscene where K Rool slips on the final (3rd) banana peel. (Note that the Trombone playing cutscene is NOT part of this since since K Rool can miss the banana and the game won't be complete.)
  * Tiny Phase: Immediately after damaging the final (4th) toe with the final (4th) hit.
  * Chunky Phase: The start of the cutscene where K Rool gets punched after the final (3rd) hit. (This is as the cutscene begins, not when Chunky connects the punch during the cutscene.)

* Using the in-game cheats menu is banned

* Taking fairy pictures through an object/wall/door/etc (VC/emulator only)

**Caveat to banned glitches: We know DK64 is incredibly buggy. Accidental glitches that save no or very minimal time will not invalidate a run.**

## Additional Randomizer Clarifications
