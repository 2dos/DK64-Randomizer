- Helm Start & Helm Room Count shouldn't be in QoL
- Hints being in "QoL" feels wrong
- Unify the level requirements section
    - Stick the "plando B. Lockers/T&S" in a modal
    - Put requirements for RW Coin/Medals/RW GB/Mermaid GB into a general "requirements" section
- "Game Length" should really be endgame
- Starting kongs shouldn't be in endgame, doesn't match
- Difficulty doesnt' fit in well with "overworld"
- Put K Rool phase shuffle & Helm room shuffle in endgame
- Put shuffle shop locations with the rest of the location randomizers
- Put autocomplete with shuffle bonuses/disable hard minigames
- Put K Rool phases as bosses with endgame?
- Move switchsanity to requirements?
