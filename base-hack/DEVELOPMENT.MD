# Developing the base hack of DK64 Randomizer
## Initial Setup
1. [Fork the DK64 Randomizer Repo](https://github.com/2dos/DK64-Randomizer/fork)
2. Create a branch based off the dev branch, and load that new branch up using GitHub desktop or the git client of your choice.
3. In a command prompt, navigate to the base directory of the repo. Run the following: ```python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt```
4. Place a DK64 US ROM called `dk64.z64` in `./base-hack/rom/`. If you have a `.n64`, you can use [this](https://hack64.net/tools/swapper.php) tool to swap the endianness of the ROM so that it'll work with the build procedure.
5. Go to the base-hack directory in the command prompt and run ```./build.bat --test python``` in command prompt. This will start the build process of the base hack of DK64 Randomizer and produce a ROM in the `./base-hack/rom` directory called `dk64-randomizer-base-dev.z64` which you can open in your emulator of choice. This is a way to generate a ROM to test scenarios without having to go through the generator. The first run of this will take a while as there's a lot of initial setup that the build procedure has to do.
## Final necessities before pushing your changes
1. Once you are happy with your changes and it's behaving as you would expect, run `Lint Repo` in the VSCode tasks.
2. Run ```./build.bat - python``` in a the command prompt in the `./base-hack` directory. This is necessary as the last step because it creates the patch file used by the generator.
