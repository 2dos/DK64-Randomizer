"""
So for coin logic, we want to make sure the player can't spend coins incorrectly and lock themselves out.
This means every buyable item has to account for, potentially, buying every other possible item first.
So each price will be inflated by a lot for logic purposes.
Total prices are as follows, in vanilla:
Cranky generic: 12
Cranky specific: 15
Candy generic: 21
Candy specific: 3
Funky generic: 20
Funky specific: 3
Total one kong can possibly spend: 74

The following only applies if move locations are not decoupled, meaning certain locations must be bought in sequence:
So basically, whatever "line" the kong is buying from, need to subtract prices
from future entries in that line from 74 (or whatever the max is if prices are random).
So since Cranky's upgrades cost 3, 5, and 7, the logical price of his
first upgrade will be 74 - 7 - 5 = 62.
Since prices can be randomized, we will dynamically subtract the prices of future purchases
in any given sequence.

If moves are decoupled so that they don't need be bought in sequence, then any location could be the final location,
meaning we just must consider the maximum price for every location.
